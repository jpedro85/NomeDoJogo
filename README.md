# Game Concept: Healthy Lifestyle 3D Mobile Game

## Introduction

The initial scope of the game is to improve the player's lifestyle, making it healthier. The game will be developed as a 3D mobile game using the Unity platform. The target audience includes young people, young adults, and adults under 60 years old. A mobile device is required to play.

## Objectives

### Option 1: Life Maze
Complete the maze representing the character's life path, with the character aging as they approach the end.

### Option 2: Real-world Maze Collection
Collect and complete mazes scattered in the real world (similar to Pokemon Go). The character has life, energy, and intelligence points.

## Challenges

- The player's energy is proportional to the accumulated steps, and life is lost during inactivity (specific duration to be decided).
- Life can be regained or lost based on the type of food consumed.
- Healthy foods restore life, while unhealthy ones cause life loss.
- Some unhealthy foods provide more energy than healthy ones.
- Intelligence points are earned by collecting healthy foods and extra points by answering quizzes.
- Intelligence points help obtain hints to navigate the maze.
- Quizzes are related to food descriptions, encouraging learning about nutrition.

### Consequences

- Option 1: Player restarts the level when life reaches zero.
- Option 2: Player loses the maze and must retrieve it.

### Life Levels

- Lower life triggers various events (blurred vision, fainting, dizziness, etc.).
- Mazes have obstacles (puzzle doors, traps) for the player to overcome.

## Effects

- Blurred Vision: Character loses part of their vision, making maze navigation challenging.
- Fainting: The character falls asleep and wakes up in a different location.
- Dizziness: Movement becomes more challenging, wasting player steps.
- Death: Player restarts the game, losing progress and unexplored mazes.

## Pets

- Pets play a crucial role, collecting food during the maze.
- Collected food turns into currency used to unlock pets with unique abilities.
- Pets have happiness levels that decrease over inactivity time.
- Unhappy pets may run away to find a new owner.

## Controls

- Crouch
- Crawl (consumes less energy than walking but slower)
- Jump (consumes energy per jump)
- Run (consumes more energy than walking)
- Walk

## Persuasion Methods

- **Reward and Achievement:** Players earn points for collecting food, answering quizzes, and completing mazes, receiving intelligence points, life points, and game progression.
- **Gamification:** The game uses maze mechanics, life, and step elements to promote a healthier lifestyle.
- **Negative Consequences:** The threat of losing life due to unhealthy choices or inactivity motivates players to make healthier decisions.
- **Long-term Rewards:** Unlocking pets provides a long-term incentive for players to continue playing.
- **Emotions and Personal Connections:** Happiness levels and the possibility of pets leaving persuade players to care for their virtual companions.
- **Challenges:** Obstacles, traps, and effects add challenges, prompting players to adapt strategies.

To encourage healthy food choices and positive behaviors, nudges are used, such as rewards for healthy foods, penalties for unhealthy foods, pet care, challenging obstacles, and educational quizzes about foods. These elements subtly influence players to adopt a healthier lifestyle.
